# DungeonOfLegends
School Project - Java Rogue Like

## About
<br/>
A machiavellian wizard and his devious ducks let the lights of the dungeon switched on ! How obnoxious ! As "Raoul l'Ampoule", you can't let this happen, and decide to go switch them all off. Beware of the traps ! 

<br/>
### Gameplay

You may play alone or with a friend, which will play "Marie-Loue la roue", with different characteristics !

The goal is to get the highest score you can. Both killing ducks and switching off bulbs give you points. The game autosaves each time you go downstairs.
